# Projection Separability Indices

*This python package is based on the MATLAB project
named [projection-separability-indices](https://github.com/biomedical-cybernetics/projection-separability-indices).*

## Description

The projection separability indices (PSIs) are statistical-based measures specifically designed to assess and quantify
the group separability of data samples in a geometrical space (
see [Measuring group-separability in geometrical space for evaluation of pattern recognition and embedding algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12418)
for more details). For instance, PSIs can be used to evaluate the quality of the dimensionality reduction analyses
produced by embedding algorithms. Currently, this package implements four different PSIs for evaluating group
separability and a statistical test termed _trustworthiness_ (
see [Nonlinear machine learning pattern recognition and bacteria-metabolite multilayer network analysis of perturbed gastric microbiome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22135-x)
for a practical example and more details) which is based on a null model to assess the statistical significance of each
PSI by a p-value.

### PSI measures

* **psi-p**: Based on the Mann-Whitney U-test p-value [1]
* **psi-roc**: Based on the Area Under the ROC-Curve [2]
* **psi-pr**: Based on the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve [3]
* **psi-mcc**: Based on the Matthews Correlation Coefficient [4]

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```shell
pip install psis
```

## Usage

### Compute PSIs

```python
import numpy as np
from psis import indices

"""
Simulated embedding obtained by a dimension reduction method.
In this example, only two dimensions are used. however, an arbitrary 
number of dimensions can be evaluated.
Note: It is expected to receive samples as rows and the features/variables as columns.
"""
embedding = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [10, 11], [12, 13], [14, 15], [16, 17]])

"""
List of sample labels (groups/classes).
In this example, only two different groups are used. However, an arbitrary 
number of classes can be evaluated
"""
labels = np.array(['group1', 'group1', 'group1', 'group1', 'group2', 'group2', 'group2', 'group2'])

"""
List of positive samples.
Depending on the study, positive classes are usually ranked as 
the labels for which a particular prediction is desired. 

For instance: 
- sick patients (positive class) versus controls (negative class)
- burnout (positive class), depression (positive class), versus control (negative class)
 
If you are not sure which are your positive classes, then omit this input and the 
algorithm will take the groups with the lower number of samples as positive
"""
positives = np.array(['group1'])

"""
Base approach for defining the groups' centroids.

Available options are:
- mean
- median [default]
- mode
"""
center_formula = 'median'

# Group separability evaluation
psi_p, psi_roc, psi_pr, psi_mcc = indices.compute_psis(embedding, labels, positives, center_formula)

print(psi_p)
print(psi_roc)
print(psi_pr)
print(psi_mcc)
```

### Compute trustworthiness of PSIs

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from psis import indices

# Sample data. Details at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
data = load_iris()

# Number of iterations for the Null model
iterations = 50

# Random seed (for reproducibility)
seed = 10

# Group separability evaluation.
# In this example, the evaluation of group separability is directly
# assessed in the High-Dimensional (HD) space, and the trustworthiness of
# each PSI (together with details about their null model evaluation) is returned
results = indices.compute_trustworthiness(data.data, data.target, iterations=iterations, seed=seed)

# Accessing the results
# In this example only 'psi_roc' is evaluated. The other indices' results can be 
# accessed in the same way
print(results['psi_roc']['value'])  # Initial index value
print(results['psi_roc']['min'])  # Minimum permuted value
print(results['psi_roc']['max'])  # Maximum permuted value
print(results['psi_roc']['p_value'])  # Separability significance (p-value)
```
